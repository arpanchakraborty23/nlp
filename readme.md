## Foundations of NLP
- **Linguistics Basics**: Understanding syntax, semantics, morphology, and phonology.
- **Statistics and Probability**: Basic concepts essential for probabilistic models.
- **Mathematics for NLP**: Linear algebra, calculus, and optimization.

## Text Preprocessing
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words, subwords, or sentences.
- **Normalization**: Lowercasing, removing punctuation, and stemming/lemmatization.
- **Stop Words Removal**: Filtering out common but non-informative words.
- **Text Cleaning**: Handling misspellings, special characters, and noise.

## Basic NLP Tasks
- **Text Representation**: Bag of Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying proper names in text.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS)**: Labeling parts of speech in sentences.
- **Chunking**: Grouping POS tags into phrases.

## Machine Learning for NLP
- **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, and logistic regression.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from text data.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Advanced Text Representations
- **Word Embeddings**: Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.
- **Contextual Embeddings**: ELMo, BERT, GPT.

## Deep Learning for NLP
- **Neural Networks**: Basics of neural networks, backpropagation.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: LSTM and GRU.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Understanding attention and self-attention.
- **Transformers**: BERT, GPT, and other transformer-based models.

## NLP Applications
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing sentiment in text.
- **Text Classification**: Classifying text into predefined categories.
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.
- **Summarization**: Generating concise summaries of documents.
- **Question Answering**: Building systems that answer questions posed in natural language.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, Scikit-learn.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers.

## Practical Projects
- **Build an NER System**: Use spaCy or Hugging Face.
- **Create a Sentiment Analysis Model**: Using pre-trained models or custom datasets.
- **Develop a Chatbot**: Incorporate NLP techniques and frameworks.
- **Text Generation**: Using models like GPT-3.

## Keeping Up-to-date
- **Research Papers**: Regularly read papers from ACL, EMNLP, and NAACL.
- **Online Courses and Tutorials**: Coursera, edX, and YouTube channels.
- **Communities**: Join NLP communities on GitHub, Stack Overflow, and Reddit.
